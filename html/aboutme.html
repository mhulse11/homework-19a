      <p>My name is Michael, I located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Where I am a 
        Licensed Massage therapist, and Certifed UX/UI designer. I have been 
        practicing Massage therapy for 6 year now. Although I am new to the 
        UX world I have been in the user experience world for the last few year
        because my approach to massage is similar to web and app design. 
        My focus is on forming a full understanding of our users and bring them 
        the best product or experience possible.  One of my favorite parts is 
        Bringing our users story to life. Though story boarding and empathy 
        mapping I am able to bring all of their thought into the picture.
        
        When I am not designing or massaging, you can find me out in the
        mountains biking, rock climbing or skiing. My passion for the outdoors
        is  prevalent in everything I do. I am to be the best version of myself 
        In and out of the office. My aim is to clean up the wilderness as well as 
        Peoples expereiences when interacting with compainies. </p>
